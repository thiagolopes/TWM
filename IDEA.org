* Keybinds Emacs like

Like in emacs:

| Annotation | Keybinds     |
|------------+--------------|
| ~M-<key>~  | ~Alt+<key>~  |
| ~C-<key>~  | ~Ctrl+<key>~ |

Also like in emacs, each key interacte with one type if element:

~M~ interact with workspaces
~C~ interact with windows

So:
~M-1~ means "workspace one" and ~C-1~ means "window one".
